## FitDash

The obesity and lack of health crisis has been a major problem for many years in America, affecting many of the people I know and care about. I made this app to help simplify and improve the wellness of my loved ones and friends, as well as strangers or whoever needs it. A lack of health affects almost the majority of people in the U.S., so simplifying and creating a free system for self improvement could benefit this greatly. I hope that whoever you are, you take this opportunity to better yourself and to take care of yourself.

This project also demonstrates my proficiency in JQuery, CSS, and HTML. Thanks for visiting!

A fitness and wellness app designed to unify and improve self management / self care systems. With this system, you can: 

- Calculate the calories needed to sustain, lose, or gain weight.
- Create a strength training and cardio routine, customized to your liking.
- See an overview of your plan, with a full manual and log-on tracking system

In the future, a social media component may be added to aid the motivational and consistency component to this app.
